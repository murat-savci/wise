Introduction
------------

WiSE (Wireless Internet Sensing Environment) is researching and testing new
techniques for monitoring that can be used to understand how our natural world
is being impacted and changing as the Digital Economy develops, providing
essential information that allows people to introduce new ways of operation
that can positively impact the natural environment.

The WiSE platform combines new digital techniques to support a range of new
applications. The project uses digital cameras to record high quality imagery -
both still images and video content. Advanced coding methods detect and
compress relevant imagery. The project has designed a system that allows
retrieving data using low-cost satellite networking. This flexible approach
represents a new paradigm for collecting environmental data enhancing accuracy
and quality, with the potential to revolutionize data collection. The
techniques are expected to find application in many arenas allowing future
support of a range of applications.

The WiSE project is:

 * Developing an effective, digital platform for non-invasive monitoring;
 * Research video compression and processing algorithms to enable automated
   selection and subsequent display of desired imagery;
 * Researching and developing mechanisms for transport, and management of
   imagery captured in remote areas;
 * Exploring user-driven exemplar scenarios to use the platform and evaluate
   the impact of using imagery in each scenario.
 * Exploring the potential for using the new techniques to enable
   transformational impact.

The first application of the WiSE platform is to a remote upland area to assess
the impact of changes in a critical aspect of deer management. This deployment
took place in July 2013 and is exploring a new approach for biodiversity
management in an extremely remote location, with data collection via satellite.

A series of stand-alone camera traps is also being developed during the
project. These use some of the methods developed for the WiSE platform, but
seek to transfer this to a low-cost solution that can be used in a series of
field trials to monitor wildlife in different locations.
